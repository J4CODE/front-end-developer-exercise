Per jQuery Library docs:  

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

**For the User Interface we also used jQuery UI:**

Per jQuery UI Docs:   

jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. Whether you're building highly interactive web applications or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice.

**In order to create the best match for the color gradients used for the tabs, I decided to go with ColorZilla.**

>### JavaScript Can Also Be Disabled
> By opening inspect element, in the pages web browser and disabling JavaScript, all of the user interface works, except the Dynamic Content user story, where friends names appear pending the baby steps tab chosen to see who also is on that particular baby step. That will require JavaScript to be enabled in the browser.
